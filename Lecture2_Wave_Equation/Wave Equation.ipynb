    "Imagine you have an ideal string of length L and would like to find an equation that describes the oscillation of the string. Assuming the string is fixed at its ends and starts its motion in a known position f(x) the simplest assumption one can make is that the acceleration of each piece of the string is somewhat proportional to the curvature of the string as such:\n",

To think about it, any function that has the argument x-ct or x+ct or a combination of both is a solution to the wave equation. This means that we can model a lot of different waves!  Furthermore, as you could probably spot, the general solution is a combination of a wave travelling to the left and one travelling to the right.\n",
